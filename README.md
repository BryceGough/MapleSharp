C# XNA Maplestory Client

I've added a lot of the main stuff but it still needs a lot, also my collision and character drawing could do with some work as I got lazy and guessed numbers to add to the origin.
I thought I'd upload this so I could start with a new project, but I didn't want to see this work goto waste.
I hope people can learn or upgrade my code, I will be adding little bits every now and then but its mostly upto you :)
